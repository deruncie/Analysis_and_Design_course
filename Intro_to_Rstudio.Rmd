# Quick Intro to R

Learning how to manipulate and analyze data in R will be a very valuable skill.
This document is designed to introduce you to some of the basic ideas that are widely applicable.
We start with bringing data into our environment & loading packages before moving into simple calculations, vectors, data.frames, lists, data management, and finally plotting.

## What is R? Why use R?

R is a programming language that specializes in statistical computing and data visualization.\

It is open-source, free, and most often is used with RStudio, which provides a simple interface for users to view their code scripts, evaluate code in the **Console**, view generated plots, and navigate their file directory.
Because it is open-source, it provides many user-created packages for statistical analysis (as we'll see later).

## R scripts

R scripts are text files (like this one) that contain all R commands necessary to run an analysis.
There are typically two types of R scripts:

-   Files with the `.R` file extension can be run from start to finish and can be "executed" to run complex programs - we won't be using them much in this class.
-   Files with the `.Rmd` file extension are R markdown notebooks, and are the ones we'll be working with in this class. They provide more options for entering text and allow users to create code blocks that run separately.

Scripts work just like entering commands sequentially into the **Console**, but provide a history of what you did.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


### Comments (the '\#' symbol):

```{r}
# The pound sign/hashtag is very important in R. 
# The '#' denotes that the text following it is a comment. 
# Anything written after a '#' will not be treated as an instruction for R to run. 
# In RStudio, you can see that text after a '#' changes color to indicate it's a comment, and not code. 
# You can use comments to explain in plain English what your code is doing, and why. 
# Your code should have lots of comments.  
# Comments can come after a command on the same line or on their own line. Nothing is returned from this chunk.
```

### Code blocks

Below is a code block that is used in R markdown files.
In a code block, all text is interpreted as `R` code that should be evaluated.
Any line that should not be evaluated (e.g. not an R command or code you don't want to run) should be started with a `#`.
You can run each line separately or run the whole code block at once using the green arrow.
Check your keyboard shortcuts in Tools \> Keyboard Shortcuts Help to make running code easier.

```{r}
'Hello world'
# A comment
```

Did you notice a new window appear under the code block?
We call this the "output" window - it prints out all lines in the code block that are meant to be printed out.
Depending on the assignment, we may ask you to keep this output in your submission so we can check your numbers.

When compiling an R markdown document, you can click the **Knit** button - a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Use R as a mathematical and boolean calculator:

Run each of the commands below separately by putting your cursor on the line and clicking **Run** above

```{r}
# as you would expect the standard computer calculator symbols apply: 
# + is addition
# - is subtraction
# * is multiplication
# / is division
# ^ or ** are exponents

2*3
(1+2+3)/3
2^3
```

R has many functions for doing math:

```{r}
sqrt(4) # square root
pi
exp(1) # the natural exponential
log(exp(1)) # natural log
log2(2) # log base 2
log10(10) # log base 10
```

R can evaluate logical statements:

```{r}
5 > 3    # > is greater than, < is less than
6 == 5   # two equal signs is the logical test (is equal to). (One equal sign is assignment. see below)
5 != 3   # not equal to
5 >= 5   # greater than or equal to

# compare text (character strings)
"bookshelves" == "a totally different character"
"apples" != "oranges"
"apples" != "Apples" # R is always case-sensitive
```

### Packages: using `install.packages()` and `library()`:

There are thousands of free packages available that extend R's functionality.
Each package includes one or more functions that do specific tasks.
Packages can be installed with the function: `install.packages()`, or using the **Packages** window in RStudio.

The following code will install most of the packages we will use in this course

```{r}
# install.packages(c('rmarkdown','learnr', 'readr', 'devtools','Matrix','lme4','lmerTest','pbkrtest','multcomp','multcompView','car','emmeans','ggplot2', 'cowplot')) 
# remove the `#` symbol to run once. Then add it back so it doesn't run again!
# devtools::install_github('deruncie/PLS205_package')
# you can also install user-developed packages from Github
```

Once packages are installed, you need to load them each time you want to use them:

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)
library(PLS205)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R programming

Running analyses in R is more than just loading data and writing the right model.

A good analysis will perform and document all steps in your workflow, from data cleaning, pre-processing, modeling, interpretation, and display.

These tasks require learning a bit about how to write scripts or programs.

Below, we demonstrate some key tools for working in the `R` language:

### Getting help

1.  Search in the **Help** pane.
2.  Type `?` or alternatively `help` and `??` (or alternatively `help.search`). Use `?` (or `help(yourcommand)`) if you know the exact command name and use `??yourcommand` (or `help.search("yourcommand")`) if you don't know the command name, R will return a list of commands matching (somehow) your search.

```{r}
?read.csv	# the same as help(read.csv)
??lmer	# the same as help.search("lmer")
```

3.  Search online. Pretty much any question you might have has been asked by someone in some forum. Learning how to find these answers is a very useful skill. Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT, Copilot) can be useful but may provide code that is more complicated than needed for this class (and potentially give undesired answers)!

### Variables

Variables are a named "object" that stores a value so you can reference it later.
Similar to how you would define a variable in math like $x = 5$, you can do this in R with numbers, character strings, or sets of data.
Use the `<-` operator to perform variable assignment.
The `=` operator also works.

```{r}
# assign variable x to be 5 and y to be 6
x <- 5
y <- 6
# add x and y
x + y

# assign a character string to z
z <- "bookshelf"
z
```

### Vectors

Vectors are one-dimensional simple lists of values.

Vectors are useful for grouping similar objects together.

Vectors can be created with the `c()` concatenation function:

```{r}
# vector of characters
furniture <- c("sofa", "chair", "table", "desk")
furniture

# vector of numbers
heights <- c(85.4, 98, 45, 55, 3.7)
heights
```

Elements of vectors can be named

```{r}
furniture_sizes <- c(sofa = 83, chair = 30, table = 102)
furniture_sizes
```

Elements of vectors can be accessed with brackets `[]`

```{r}
furniture[2]
heights[3:5]
furniture_sizes['sofa']
```

> We'll use vectors like this to store answers in homeworks and exams.

When data is stored in a vector, we can apply the same operation to each element of the vector

```{r}
heights
heights + 10
heights > 80
```

### Calling R functions

Functions are the workhorses of R.
They can do simple things, like find the mean of some numbers, load data, or evaluate complicated models.
Pretty much everything you do in R involves using (or writing your own) functions, so it's important to understand how they work.

Here are some functions:

```{r}
mean(c(1,2,3)) # calculates the mean
sort(c(10,3,2,5)) # sorts numbers
qnorm(p = 0.95,mean = 10,sd = 3) # finds the 0.95 critical value of a normal distribution with mean = 10 and sd = 3
```

Functions take *arguments* as input, and then *return* values as output.
If you call a function by itself like above, the result is added directly to your R Notebook in the chunk output.
However, you can *assign* this output to a variable with the `=` symbol

```{r}
m3 = mean(c(1,2,3))
m3
```

Most functions require that you provide them data to work on - these are what are known as arguments (also called parameters).
You can see what a function requires to run in it's help page by typing `?mean`, or highlighting the word and typing `F1`.
The help page lists the arguments of a function in RStudio's help pane.
Each argument is named.
Some arguments have default argument values.
You don't have to pass an argument that has a default value if you want to use that value.

Compare how we called `mean` and `qnorm` above.
Note that we specified the argument names in `qnorm`, but not for `mean`.
Argument names aren't strictly required as long as you pass the values in the correct order.
But it's always a good idea to use the name so that your code is easier to read, and it's easier to find mistakes.

The qnorm function could also have been called like this:

```{r}
qnorm(p = 0.95,m = 10,s = 3) 
```

*Partial matching* of argument names works to save you time (as long as it's unambiguous which argument you mean, R will guess).
But this is a bit dangerous too - we'll give you some tips later!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Working with data

All data that we will work with in this class will be spreadsheet-like, meaning that it will be arranged in columns, with rows as observations, and columns as descriptors or numbers.
A simple data set is provided called `iris_data.csv`.
Open this data in Excel and look at it.
Note that each plant is given one row, and is labeled with a species and four measurements.

### loading data

The main functions for reading data into `R` are: `read.csv`, `read.tsv`, or `read.delim`, depending on how your data are encoded.
Data values in files are delimited by a specific character: for instance, `.csv` files stand for comma-separated files and `.tsv` stand for tab-separated files.

```{r}
iris <- read.csv('Background/data/iris_data.csv')  # default function
iris <- read.csv('Background/data/iris_data.csv',header = TRUE)  # explicitly specify that the first row of the data contains column names
iris <- read.delim('Background/data/iris_data.csv',header = TRUE,sep=',')  # explicitly specify that entries are separated by commas
```

> The above commands have three important parts:
>
> 1.  The **function** (read.csv or read.delim) reads data.
> 2.  The function call is given **arguments** that tell it what to do. Here, we provide first a filename, and other parameters to control its behavior.
> 3.  The **assignment operator** `<-`. This tells R to take the output of the function (here, the loaded data), and assign it to the **object** called `iris`. Once the data is assigned to the object `iris`, it is held in memory and we can access it with other functions. You can see all objects you have currently in memory in RStudio's **Environment** window. **Note**, for our purposes, you can equivalently use `=` for assignment.

You must give these functions the filepath, or the location of your data **relative** to your working directory (usually where you have saved your .Rmd file).

For instance, if `iris_data.csv` is in the same folder as your code, then you can tell `read.csv()` to find your data using the filepath `'iris_data.csv'`.
But if it's nested within the directory `data`, then you will have to give the filepath `'data/iris_data.csv'`.

RStudio also provides a neat tool for importing data.
Choose `File -> Import Dataset -> From Text (base)`, select the file name, then use the dialog box to describe the file.
This will generate an R command for you and run it in the console.
Simply copy that command, and paste it into your document here:

```{r}
# Copy the import command that RStudio generated for you and paste it here in your script

```

### Viewing data

Now that the data are loaded and assigned to the object `iris`, we can view it in several ways:

```{r}
iris
# alternative: print(iris)
```

Simply typing the name of the object and running the code **prints** out the whole object to the screen.
(You can close this view by clocking the little `x` icon in the top-right corner of the output)

```{r}
str(iris)
```

`str` is a **function** that provides a concise summary of the data.
Note that `iris` is a data.frame, with 150 observations and 5 variables.
The first four variables are all numbers, and the 5th is a Factor.
We'll discuss the differences later.

RStudio also provides the function `View()`.
It will bring up something that look like a spreadsheet in a new window.

```{r}
summary(iris)
View(iris)
```

`summary` is similar to `str` but calculates numerical summaries of each column.

### Accessing data

Now that your data are loaded, we can access it in several ways:

```{r}
iris[,1]
```

This gives the first row of the data

```{r}
iris$Sepal.Length
# alternatives: iris[,1], iris[,'Sepal.Length'], iris[['Sepal.Length]]
```

This accesses all the values in the `Sepal.Length` column.

Vectors can also be extracted from data.frames:

```{r}
observation_1 <- iris[1,]
observation_1

data_1 <- iris$Sepal.Length
data_1
```

`observation_1` and `data_1` are both vectors, but represented slightly differently.
Note here that because of this, the output block contains multiple windows for you to view each output.

Commands can be combined:

```{r}
summary(iris$Sepal.Width)
```

```{r}
head(iris$Petal.Length)
```

Data can be accessed and assigned to a new **object**

```{r}
setosa <- subset(iris,Species == 'setosa')
str(setosa)
```

> Notes:
>
> 1.  The function `subset` takes two arguments: a data.frame (iris), and then a logical vector specifying which **rows** of the data.frame to select
> 2.  The output is a new data.frame with only the observations of the **setosa** species listed

We can now reference the setosa data specifically:

```{r}
mean(setosa$Sepal.Length)
```

### Using the tab auto-complete:

We mentioned the danger of incomplete argument names and you may often find yourself misspelling variable names in your career.
R provides a way for you to auto-complete!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# the tab key can be used to auto-complete words in R. This can save a lot of typing!

# It works for the columns of a data.frame (the standard object for holding data files)
# try hitting tab with the cursor after `iris$Sep` below:
iris$Sep

# It works for variable names you've used already in this document:
# try below;  
seto

# It works for any R function in any package you've already loaded:
read.cs

# It also works with files and directories:
'Background/data/iris_dat'

```

### Plotting data

R has many functions for plotting data.

There are two main flavors: **base graphics**, and **ggplot** graphics.
base graphics are quicker, but ggplot graphics look much better and are faster for some tasks

#### scatterplot

```{r}
# using base graphics
plot(x = iris$Sepal.Length,y = iris$Sepal.Width,            # Note: commands can extend across lines
     xlab = 'Sepal Length (mm)', ylab = 'Sepal Width (mm)',
     main = 'Iris Sepals')

# using the ggplot library - you may have to install it if you haven't already!
library(ggplot2)
# tell ggplot what columns to use for "aes"thetics 
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Length,y=Sepal.Width)) + 
  # add a scatter plot with geom_point and tell it to use the 'Species" column for color
  geom_point(aes(color = Species)) +
  # add a title!
  ggtitle('Iris Sepals')
```

#### Boxplots

```{r}
# base
boxplot(iris$Petal.Length~iris$Species,
        ylab = 'Petal.Length',ylim = c(0,8),
        main = 'Iris petals')
# ggplot
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Species,y=Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + ylim(c(0,8))

```

#### Histograms

```{r}
# base
hist(iris$Sepal.Width,breaks = 10)
# ggplot
ggplot(iris,aes(x=Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10,alpha = 0.7,color='white')
```
